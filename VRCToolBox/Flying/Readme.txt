To use this script, create a new UdonSharpBehaviour script in Unity and paste the code above into it. Then, attach the script to an object in your scene.

Make sure you have the VRCSDK and UdonSharp installed in your project. Also, note that this script assumes that you're using the default VRChat UI, so if you're using a custom UI, you may need to modify the code to match your UI hierarchy.

Finally, don't forget to assign the flyingToggle variable in the inspector to a Toggle UI element that you've added to your Tools submenu.
