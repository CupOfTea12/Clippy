To use this script, create a new UdonSharpBehaviour script in Unity and paste the code above into it. Then, attach the script to an object in your scene.

In the inspector, assign the mirrorObject variable to the game object that contains the VRC_Mirror component you want to toggle.

Finally, make sure that your VRChat user has access to the Quick Menu (by default, it's bound to the "ESC" key), and the "Mirror" toggle button should now appear in the Quick Menu. Clicking the button will toggle the mirror on and off.
