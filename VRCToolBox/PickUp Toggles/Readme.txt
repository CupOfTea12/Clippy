To use this script, create a new UdonSharpBehaviour script in Unity and paste the code above into it. Then, attach the script to an object in your scene.

In the inspector, you can set the enablePickups variable to true if you want pickups to be enabled by default, or false if you want pickups to be disabled by default.

Finally, make sure that your VRChat user has access to the Quick Menu (by default, it's bound to the "ESC" key), and the "Pickups" toggle button should now appear in the Quick Menu. Clicking the button will toggle all pickups in the current VRChat world on or off.
